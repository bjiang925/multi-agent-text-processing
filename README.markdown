# Multi-Agent Text Processing System

This project is a Streamlit application that leverages the OpenAI API to perform various text processing tasks through a multi-agent system. Each agent specializes in a different aspect of text analysis and enhancement, such as summarization, tone adjustment, sentiment analysis, translation, style enhancement, and readability scoring.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Uncompress the Zip File**
   - Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Open a terminal and change to the project's root directory:
     ```
     cd path/to/multi_agent_text_processing
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages**
   - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Set Up Your API Key**
   - Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
   - Set the API key as an environment variable:
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```
       export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```
       set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
       ```

5. **Start the Streamlit App**
   - Launch the application with:
     ```
     streamlit run streamlit_app.py
     ```
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the app.

## Sample Input Data

To get started, you can copy and paste the following sample text inputs into the applicationâ€™s input forms. Note that processing times may vary depending on the task and API response.

- **For Summarization:**
  ```
  Artificial intelligence is transforming industries by automating tasks and providing insights from data. From healthcare to finance, AI is enhancing efficiency and decision-making.
  ```

- **For Tone Adjustment:**
  ```
  The report was not good. It missed key points and lacked clarity.
  ```

- **For Sentiment Analysis:**
  ```
  I love the new features in this app! They make my work so much easier.
  ```

- **For Translation (to Spanish):**
  ```
  Hello, how are you today?
  ```

- **For Style Enhancement:**
  ```
  The data shows a increase in sales. This is good for the company.
  ```

- **For Readability Scoring:**
  ```
  Utilizing obfuscatory lexemes in textual compositions can obfuscate the intended message, thereby diminishing the communicative efficacy.
  ```

Feel free to experiment with your own text inputs to explore the full range of features offered by the multi-agent system.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues:** Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set and has the necessary permissions.
- **Dependency Errors:** Verify that all packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed. You can check with `pip list`.
- **Streamlit Not Running:** Make sure you are in the correct directory and that `streamlit_app.py` exists.
